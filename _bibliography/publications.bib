  abstract      = {The somatosensory system enables us to recognize objects, discern textures, and integrate sensorimotor feedback by extracting relevant features of the tactile world. One such feature is the direction that a stimulus moves across the skin. While neural tuning to direction has been described within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we do not know whether this region is required for perception of this tactile feature. Therefore, we designed an operant training paradigm to require head- and paw-restrained mice to report the direction of movement across the glabrous (non-hairy) skin of the mouse forepaw and then employed optogenetic silencing approaches to evaluate the contributions of three cortical regions to the perception of tactile movement direction. We trained VGAT-ChR2 transgenic mice to perform a go/no-go operant task for discrimination of the direction (proximal to distal vs. distal to proximal) of a light brushing stimulus across the glabrous skin of the left forepaw. Once the mice reached a criterion performance of discrimination index (d prime) ≥ 2.0, we directed focused laser light (445 nm, 40 Hz pulses, 5 mW average power) to one of three cortical regions (contralateral to the paw stimulus) or a non-brain control area throughout the duration of the stimulus presentation on each trial. Optogenetic silencing of forepaw S1, but not hindpaw S1 or posterior parietal cortex, resulted in decreased performance in VGAT-ChR2 mice compared to interleaved control trials (d primes of 2.24 ± 0.16 [mean ± SEM] and 1.10 ± 0.19 for control and forepaw S1 locations, respectively). Therefore, activity in forepaw S1 is required for mice to reliably report the direction of tactile stimuli.bibtex_show = true, }

  abstract  = {(translated) In recent years, research on self-control has shifted from a primary focus on inhibitory functions and willpower resources to the exploration of more effortless mechanisms, such as the use of self-control strategies. The Preventive and Interventive Model (PI-Model; Hofmann & Kotabe, 2012) distinguishes between preventive and interventive strategies and proposes that preventive strategies are generally more effective. However, to date, there has been no instrument available to assess the use of self-control strategies in everyday life, limiting empirical investigation of this hypothesis. This study developed a Self-Control Strategy Questionnaire by coding qualitative data on university students’ self-control experiences and aligning item construction with the conceptual definitions of the PI-Model. The questionnaire’s factor structure, internal consistency, criterion validity (with preventive coping and behavioral impulsivity as benchmarks), and incremental validity (controlling for good habits and effortful inhibition) were examined across three independent student samples targeting general, financial, and academic goals, respectively. The final 19-item questionnaire demonstrated good psychometric properties and identified four distinct types of strategies: temptation-focused preventive strategies, goal-focused preventive strategies, interpersonal preventive strategies, and interventive strategies. This classification expands the PI-Model’s typology and aligns with classical self-regulation theories such as Carver and Scheier’s control theory and dual-system models (e.g., Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999), which differentiate between approach-oriented and avoidance-oriented mechanisms. The identification of interpersonal preventive strategies reflects emerging perspectives in self-regulation research, particularly the transactive goal dynamics framework (Fitzsimons & Finkel, 2015), which highlights the interpersonal nature of goal pursuit. Notably, the findings challenge the PI-Model’s central hypothesis: preventive strategies were not inherently indicative of better self-control. Individuals with lower self-control capacity tended to rely more on interpersonal preventive strategies, whereas those with higher self-control employed interventive strategies more frequently. These results suggest that the effortfulness and effectiveness of a given strategy may vary depending on individual differences and goal contexts. The questionnaire developed in this study provides a novel tool for future research on which strategies are most efficient or effective for specific individuals and goals, and whether interventions targeting strategy use can improve self-regulatory outcomes. },
