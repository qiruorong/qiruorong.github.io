  abstract  = {Proximal tubule fructose metabolism is key to fructose-induced hypertension, but the roles of sex and stress are unclear. We hypothesized that females are resistant to the salt-sensitive hypertension caused by low amounts of dietary fructose compared to males and that the magnitude of the increase in blood pressure (BP) depends, in part, on amplification of the stress response of renal sympathetic nerves. We measured systolic BP (SBP) in rats fed high salt with either no sugar (HS), 20% glucose (GHS) or 20% fructose (FHS) in the drinking water for 7-8 days. FHS increased SBP in both males (Δ22±9 mmHg; p<0.046) and females (Δ16±3 mmHg; p<0.0007), while neither GHS nor HS alone induced changes in SBP in either sex. The FHS-induced increase in SBP as measured by telemetry in the absence of added stress (8±2 mmHg) was significantly lower than that measured by plethysmography (24±5 mmHg) (p<0.014). However, when BP was measured by telemetry simulating the stress of plethysmography, the increase in SBP was significantly greater (15±3 mmHg) than under low stress (8±1 mmHg) (p<0.014). Moderate-stress also increased telemetric diastolic (p < 0.006) and mean BP (p<0.006) compared to low-stress in FHS-fed animals. Norepinephrine excretion was greater in FHS-fed rats than HS-fed animals (Male: 6.4±1.7 vs.1.8±0.4 nmole/Kg/day; p<0.02. Female 54±18 vs. 1.2±0.6; p<0.02). We conclude that fructose-induced salt-sensitive hypertension is similar in males and females unlike other forms of hypertension, and the increase in blood pressure depends in part on an augmented response of the sympathetic nervous system to stress.},

  abstract   = {Proximal tubules (PT) reabsorb fructose via a Na-dependent mechanism. Knocking out the Sodium-Linked Cotransporter 5 (SGLT5, \textit{Slc5A10}) increases urinary fructose. Elevated dietary fructose increases transport rates in PT, contributing to salt-sensitive hypertension. Whether dietary fructose also elevates transport in other segments of the nephron that do not express known fructose transporters, is a matter of debate. The aldosterone-sensitive distal tubule (ASDT) consists of the late distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule and collecting duct, and it is essential for regulating fluid volume and blood pressure. We hypothesize that fructose metabolism in PT could affect aldosterone signaling in the distal tubule of rats fed a high-salt diet. We obtained kidney-cortex bulk RNAseq transcriptomes from wild-type and SGLT5 (-/-) Sprague Dawley rats fed a solid diet containing 4% NaCl and either 20% fructose (FHS) or glucose (GHS). We used Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) to: 1st) create a gene coexpression network of the kidney cortex, and 2nd) identify genes whose expression changes in response to fructose in both wild-type and SGLT5 (-/-). Then, we used open source transcriptomes from mouse ASDT epithelial cells (PMID: 29521601) treated with and without aldosterone to map genes whose expression changes in response to aldosterone to the coexpression modules correlated with dietary fructose. The mouse transcriptome contained 8619 genes that mapped to the rat kidney transcriptome. Of these genes, 454 were significantly changed by aldosterone (ALDO). WGCNA yielded 35 coexpression modules. Five modules were significantly associated with dietary fructose in wild-type. These correlations were blunted in SGLT5 (-/-). Enrichment analysis indicated that 4 of the 35 modules were enriched for ALDO, 2 of which (Paleturquoise: p<5x10-6 and Orange: p<3x10-2) were also correlated with fructose in wild-type (Paleturquoise: p<3x10-2 and Orange: p<4x10-2). Paleturquoise contained 108 genes of which 74 mapped to the mouse transcriptome, and 15 to ALDO. Ontology enrichments in Paleturquoise indicate that it contains genes involved in Na, Cl and HCO3 transport. Importantly, the Amiloride-Sensitive Epithelial Sodium Channel Alpha Subunit (ENaCα; Scnn1a) and the Thiazide-Sensitive Sodium-Chloride Cotransporter (NCC; Slc12a3) belong in this module. Orange contained 148 genes, of which 34 mapped to mouse transcriptomes, and only 5 to ALDO. Orange’s ontology enrichment was largely immune processes, which explain the low number of mapping genes, as ALDO is a tubular epithelial cell signature. We conclude that even on a high-salt diet, kidneys from rats given fructose present higher transcriptional activation of aldosterone-responsive genes than those given glucose. In addition, Orange may be mediating proinflammatory actions of fructose. These effects depend on fructose reabsorption by PTs, as SGLT5 deletion blunts the effects of HSF on ALDO-enriched modules.},
