        - title: Scientific Background
          description: <p>Since the 1970s, increased fructose consumption in the U.S., primarily due to the widespread use of high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener, has been linked to the rise of salt-sensitive hypertension. Understanding the mechanism of fructose-induced salt-sensitive hypertension is pivotal for the development of therapeutics that benefit patients with hypertension.</p>
        - title: Roles
          description: <p>With my expertise in biology bench skills and bioinformatics, I performed both animal studies and transcriptomic analysis on Next Generation RNA sequencing data to unveil how fructose + high salt diets increase systolic blood pressure in rats.</p>
        - title: Findings
          description: <p>My research identifies the expression pattern of the main fructose reabsorption transporter, SGLT5, in the proximal tubule (PT) of the nephron and its role in promoting PT oxidative stress, which likely contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension. Additionally, my findings suggest that salt-sensitive hypertension appears to result from fructose-induced increases in sodium reabsorption occurring at the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron.</p> 
        - title: Significance
          description: <p>My contribution helps deepen the understanding of how different nephron segments are involved in the development of hypertension and provides insights into new therapeutics for elevated blood pressure, which will benefit millions of hypertensive patients.</p>
        - title: Acknowledgments
          description: I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to Dr. Garvin and Dr. Gonzalez-Vicente. Without their guidance and encouragement, I would not be able to conduct this project. I also thank all colleagues and collaborators for their support in this study.
